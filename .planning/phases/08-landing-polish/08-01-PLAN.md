<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create landing page hero section</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx, app/(marketing)/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a marketing route group `(marketing)` with its own layout (no tenant context needed).

Create landing page at `app/(marketing)/page.tsx` with:
1. Hero section:
   - Headline: "Manage Your Trade Business in One Place"
   - Subheadline: "Bookings, estimates, invoices, and receipts - with instant Telegram notifications"
   - Primary CTA: "Start Free Trial" → /signup
   - Secondary CTA: "See Pricing" → /pricing
   - Hero visual: Abstract illustration or screenshot placeholder

2. Use glass UI styling consistent with the app:
   - Background: linear-gradient(135deg, #f0f7ff 0%, #e6f0ff 50%, #f5f5f5 100%)
   - Cards: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85) with backdrop-filter: blur(20px)
   - Shadows using rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.15)

3. Make it responsive (mobile-first)

Layout should include basic navigation with logo and "Sign Up" button.
  </action>
  <verify>Visit http://localhost:3000 - should show landing page instead of redirect</verify>
  <done>Landing page renders with hero section, CTAs link to /signup and /pricing</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create features showcase section</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add features section below the hero with 6 feature cards:

1. **Bookings** - "Schedule appointments with smart availability"
2. **Estimates** - "Create professional quotes in seconds"
3. **Invoices** - "Bill customers and track payments"
4. **Receipts** - "Snap photos, auto-extract expenses"
5. **Telegram Alerts** - "Instant notifications when customers view documents"
6. **Multi-Trade** - "Customized for mechanics, plumbers, electricians, builders"

Each card should have:
- Icon (emoji is fine for MVP)
- Title
- Short description (1-2 sentences)

Use a 3-column grid on desktop, 2-column on tablet, 1-column on mobile.
Apply glass card styling with hover effects (subtle scale/shadow change).
  </action>
  <verify>Features section visible with 6 cards, responsive layout works</verify>
  <done>Features section renders with all 6 feature cards in responsive grid</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add trust section and footer</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx, app/(marketing)/layout.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add trust/social proof section:
1. "Built for UK Tradespeople" badge
2. "7-Day Free Trial - No Card Required" message
3. Trade types supported: Car Mechanics, Plumbers, Electricians, Builders, General Trades

Add footer to marketing layout:
1. Links: Home, Pricing, Sign Up, Login
2. Copyright: "© 2026 Business Dashboard"
3. Simple, minimal design matching glass UI aesthetic

Update the marketing layout to include:
- Fixed/sticky header with logo and nav
- Footer component
  </action>
  <verify>Trust section and footer visible, all links work</verify>
  <done>Trust section shows trade types, footer has working navigation links</done>
</task>
